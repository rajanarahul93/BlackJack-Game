**Blackjack Game Project Description:**

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Blackjack card game. Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino game where the goal is to draw cards to reach a total value of 21 or as close as possible without exceeding it. The project utilizes HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

**Key Features:**

1. **Game Initialization:**
   - Players start the game by clicking the "Start Game" button, which draws two initial cards from a virtual deck.

2. **Card Drawing:**
   - Players can draw additional cards by clicking the "NEW CARD" button as long as their total sum is less than or equal to 21.

3. **Game State Display:**
   - The game state is dynamically displayed, including the player's cards, the sum of their card values, and informative messages such as whether they have Blackjack or if they're out of the game.

4. **Player Information:**
   - Player information, including the player's name and available chips, is displayed at the top of the game interface.

5. **Random Card Generation:**
   - The project incorporates a function to generate random card values, considering special rules for face cards and the Ace.

**How to Play:**

1. Click the "Start Game" button to initiate the game.
2. View your initial cards, the sum of their values, and follow the on-screen messages.
3. Optionally, click "NEW CARD" to draw additional cards and attempt to reach a sum close to 21 without exceeding it.
4. The game dynamically updates, indicating whether you have Blackjack, if you've gone over 21, or if you can draw another card.

**Note:**
- The project provides a simple and interactive way to experience the core mechanics of Blackjack in a web browser.
- It's designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand basic game flow and logic.
